<p>Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vector spaces and linear mappings between these spaces.</p>
<p>Linear algebra is foundational in many areas of mathematics and has numerous applications in diverse fields, making it a crucial subject for students and practitioners alike. Understanding its concepts and techniques enables deeper insight into mathematical modeling, data analysis, and problem-solving strategies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linear Algebra deals with vectors, system of linear equations and their matrix representations and graphing.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="variables-and-constants"><a class="header" href="#variables-and-constants">Variables and Constants</a></h1>
<h2 id="variables"><a class="header" href="#variables">Variables</a></h2>
<p>Variables are the storages whose value changes.</p>
<p>For eg: The Inflation is a variable since its value changes with time.</p>
<p>A variable can hold anything, a vector, a number, a matrix, a set... anything!</p>
<p>Certain Operations in Variables are called functions.
These functions evaluate to certain values or expressions so these functions
themselves are variables.</p>
<p>In Python, <code>x = input()</code> stores a value input that can be anything. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value of variable changes with change of objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="constants"><a class="header" href="#constants">Constants</a></h2>
<p>Constants are the storages whose value doesn't change.</p>
<p>For eg: The value of pi.</p>
<p>A Constant can hold anything but what is holds cannot be reassigned or redeclared just like how you cannot reassign the value of pi to the value of e.</p>
<p>Certain operations on Constants only lead to a Constant. This is a constant expression.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value of Constants doesn't change no matter what.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-equation"><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-equation">What is an equation?</a></h2>
<p>An equation is any set of physical quantities written as expressions that are equal.</p>
<p>For eg: x + y = 2</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-inequality"><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-inequality">What is an inequality?</a></h2>
<p>An inequality is any set of physical quantities written as expressions that are not
equal.</p>
<p>For eg: x + y &lt; 2</p>
<h2 id="types-of-inequalities"><a class="header" href="#types-of-inequalities">Types of inequalities</a></h2>
<h3 id="greater-than"><a class="header" href="#greater-than">Greater Than</a></h3>
<p>In this inequality, the left side is greater than the right side</p>
<p>For eg: 5 &gt; 3</p>
<h3 id="less-than"><a class="header" href="#less-than">Less Than</a></h3>
<p>In this inequality, the left side is less than the right side.
For eg: 3 &lt; 5</p>
<h3 id="greater-than-or-equal-to"><a class="header" href="#greater-than-or-equal-to">Greater than or equal to</a></h3>
<p>In this inequality, the left side is greater than or equal to the right side
For eg: 5 &gt;= 3</p>
<h3 id="less-than-or-equal-to"><a class="header" href="#less-than-or-equal-to">Less than or equal to</a></h3>
<p>In this inequality, the left side is less than or equal to the right side
For eg: 3 &lt;= 5</p>
<h2 id="inequality-to-equation"><a class="header" href="#inequality-to-equation">Inequality to equation</a></h2>
<p>Consider x + y &lt;= 5:
Then to equate these quantities, we can use the equation x + y + s1 = 5.
The s1 variable is a variable called slack variable. This slack variable is
added to left side as the left side was smaller than the right side.</p>
<p>Again, Consider x + y &lt;= 5:
Then to equate these quantities, we can use the equation x + y - s1 = 5.
The s1 variable is a variable called slack variable. This slack variable is
subtracted to left side as the left side was greater than the right side.</p>
<p>In both examples we didn't assign any sign to the slack variable s1.
This is called unsigned variable or basic variable.</p>
<p>In the above examples, we have used the slack variable s1 to make the equation
out of an inequality.</p>
<h2 id="algebraic-expressions"><a class="header" href="#algebraic-expressions">Algebraic expressions</a></h2>
<p>Any equation can be written in the form of algebraic expressions being equal. In the previous case,
x and y were used to denote any number.
So this notation can be used for two variables.</p>
<p>But what if there are more than two variables?
Then we can use x1,x2,x3,x4...
These variables can be called algebraic variables.</p>
<p>Any combination of these variables are used to make an algebraic expression.</p>
<h2 id="polynomial"><a class="header" href="#polynomial">Polynomial</a></h2>
<p>Any algebraic expression written in the form of purely non fractional
addition or subtraction of algebraic expressions is called a polynomial.</p>
<p>For eg: x+y, x^2 + y</p>
<h2 id="degree"><a class="header" href="#degree">Degree</a></h2>
<p>Degree of a polynomial is the highest sum of the power of all the
variable in the polynomial.</p>
<p>Consider x + y, here the highest sum of the power of all the variable is 1.
So the degree is 1.</p>
<p>Consider x + xy, here the highest sum of the power of all the variable is 2.
So the degree is 2.</p>
<p>From above example, we can conclude that the degree of a polynomial is
the highest sum of the power of all the variable in the polynomial.</p>
<h2 id="linear-polynomials"><a class="header" href="#linear-polynomials">Linear polynomials</a></h2>
<p>Any polynomial of degree 1 is called linear polynomial.</p>

<h2 id="solving-linear-equations"><a class="header" href="#solving-linear-equations">Solving linear equations</a></h2>
<p>There are many methods to solve a given system of linear equations.
Some of these methods are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Row equivalent matrix method</li>
<li>Inverse matrix method</li>
<li>Gauss Seidel approximation</li>
<li>Gaussian elimination method</li>
<li>Crammer's rule</li>
</ul>
<p>By solving the system of linear equations, we can get the value of the unknown
variables.
These values when put back in the given set of equations will satisfy the
given system of linear equations. This is true for all kinds of
equations, but the method to solve differs as the degree increases.</p>
<h2 id="degree-of-a-equation-and-inequalities"><a class="header" href="#degree-of-a-equation-and-inequalities">Degree of a equation and inequalities</a></h2>
<p>If polynomial are compared in the equations and inequalities with zero,
the degree of the polynomial is the degree of the equation or

<h2 id="solving-linear-inequality"><a class="header" href="#solving-linear-inequality">Solving linear inequality</a></h2>
<p>To solve a given set of linear inequalities, first we need an objective.
The objective is a function called objective function which is subject to
the given set of linear inequalities.
We try to maximize or minimize the objective function.</p>
<p>This can be done by checking all the possible combinations of values
that are real numbers for all the variables and then checking whether
the objective function is greater or smaller than the given objective.</p>

<li>If variance if 0 all the data is same.</li>
<li>If variance is high, then the data is spread out and the mean is not representative of the data.</li>
<li>If the variance is low, then the data is close to the mean.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="linear-regression"><a class="header" href="#linear-regression">Linear Regression</a></h1>
<p>Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. It is widely employed in various fields such as economics, finance, social sciences, engineering, and machine learning for predictive modeling and inference tasks.</p>
<p>A linear equation is in the form of y = ax_1 + b_x_2 + cx_3 + ... + z.
Where y is the dependent variable, x_1, x_2, x_3, ...,x_n are independent variables and a, b, c, ... are coefficients and z is a constant.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-regression"><a class="header" href="#what-is-regression">What is Regression?</a></h1>
<p>Regression, in general, refers to a statistical method used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. It aims to understand how changes in the independent variables are associated with changes in the dependent variable.</p>
<p>The core idea of regression analysis is to estimate the parameters of a mathematical model that best describes the relationship between the variables. The model can then be used for prediction, inference, and understanding the underlying mechanisms or patterns in the data.</p>
<p>The regression equation expresses the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. It can be linear or nonlinear, depending on the nature of the relationship.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="linear-regression-1"><a class="header" href="#linear-regression-1">Linear Regression</a></h1>
<p>Linear Regression, refers to a statistical method used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable having a linear relationship.</p>
<p>The core idea of Linear regression analysis is to estimate the parameters of a linear equation that best describes the relationship between the variables. The model can then be used for prediction.</p>
<p>The Linear regression equation expresses the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. It is always linear as this regression assumes linearity of the data. i.e when x changes y changes with a constant ratio and a bias factor which is seen as the constant in the linear equation.</p>
<p>So if the variables have a exponential relationship, the equation will give a very inaccurate prediction.</p>
<p>So we need to determine if the relationship is linear or not before doing linear regression analysis.</p>
<p>So In this case the best and most used methods are :</p>
<ol>
<li>Scatter plot</li>
<li>Correlation coefficient</li>
</ol>
<p>If there are certain segments where the ratio and bias are different, one can use different correlation coefficients to fit into many linear regression equation.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="better-case-for-linear-regression"><a class="header" href="#better-case-for-linear-regression">Better Case for Linear-Regression</a></h1>
<p>Linear Regression is a good fit for data that follows a straight line, like a line on a graph. That means there should be a pattern if the data.</p>
<p>The following are the areas where linear regression is a good fit:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Linear Relationships: Linear regression is like drawing a straight line to connect the dots on a graph. If the dots (or data points) roughly follow a straight line pattern, then linear regression works well because it can predict what the next dot might be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interpretability: Linear regression tells us how much one thing affects another. For example, if we're trying to figure out how much studying affects test scores, linear regression helps us understand how much studying more might increase our test scores.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prediction with Continuous Variables: Linear regression is good at predicting things that keep changing smoothly, like temperature or price. It's like guessing tomorrow's weather based on today's temperature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Statistical Inference: Linear regression helps us make educated guesses about a whole group of things based on a smaller sample. It's like looking at a few pieces of a puzzle and guessing what the whole puzzle might look like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stability and Robustness: Linear regression is not easily thrown off by small changes in data. It's like having a ruler that stays straight even if you shake it a little.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feature Importance and Variable Selection: Linear regression helps us figure out which factors matter the most in making predictions. For example, if we want to predict how tall someone will be, linear regression helps us decide if age or nutrition matters more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Predictive Power in Linear Relationships: When things change in a simple, straight-line way, linear regression is very good at predicting what comes next. It's like knowing that if you study one more hour, your test score might go up by a certain amount.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But sometimes, data doesn't follow straight lines. It can be all over the place, like a squiggly line or even a pattern that looks like a tree. In those cases, linear regression doesn't work well. That's when we might use decision trees, which are better at handling complex and non-linear relationships in data.</p>
<p>So, choosing between linear regression and decision trees depends on how the data behaves and what we want to find out. If things change in a nice, straight-line way, linear regression is great. But if the data is messy and doesn't follow a clear pattern, we might need a decision tree to help us make sense of it.</p>
<p>For example in python</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

california_housing = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True)
X = california_housing.data
y = california_housing.target

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

linear_reg = LinearRegression()

linear_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

predictions = linear_reg.predict(X_test)

mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
print(&quot;Mean Squared Error:&quot;, mse)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(y_test, predictions, alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel(&quot;Actual Values&quot;)
plt.ylabel(&quot;Predicted Values&quot;)
plt.title(&quot;Actual vs. Predicted Values&quot;)
plt.show()

</code></pre>
<p>Gives the following output:</p>
<p><img src="Linear-Regression/Linear-Regression/scatter_plot_of_calf.png" alt="Hello" /></p>
<p>Here the predicted values are not accurate since there is no linearity in the data.</p>
<h2 id="check-for-linearity"><a class="header" href="#check-for-linearity">Check for linearity</a></h2>
<p>To check for linearity we use correlation coefficient.
The correlation coefficient is a measure of how much two variables change together in a linear manner.
If they change in a exponential manner the prediction will not be accurate.</p>
<p>In this case,</p>
<p>Correlation Coefficient: -0.017732492614194486</p>
<p>Which means that the correlation is near to zero and a linear relationship is not found.</p>
<p>So it is not good to apply linear regression here.
This fact is clearly represented by the following line plot.</p>

<p>Decision tree is a popular way to classify data. It is also known as classification tree.</p>
<p>It uses conditionals to divide the data into groups.</p>
<p>The data is divided into groups based on the conditions and further classified into different groups.</p>
<p>These leads to a classification tree.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="conditionals"><a class="header" href="#conditionals">Conditionals</a></h1>
<p>A conditional refers to a rule or criterion used to split the data at a node into smaller subsets.</p>
<p>The conditions are based on different index:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gini Index</li>
<li>Palma Ratio</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="gini-index"><a class="header" href="#gini-index">Gini Index</a></h1>
<p>Imagine you have a set of apples and oranges mixed together. You want to separate them efficiently. Gini index tells you how likely you are to grab the wrong fruit (misclassify) if you pick one at random from the current set. By splitting the set based on features like color or size, you aim to create smaller sets with lower Gini index (mostly apples or mostly oranges), making it easier to correctly classify future fruits.</p>
<p>Now if you got the intuition we proceed to define some terms:</p>
<ol>
<li>Homogeneity: Refers to the degree of similarity within a group. In decision trees, a node is considered homogeneous if all data points belong to the same class (e.g., all apples in a set).</li>
<li>Classification accuracy: Measures how well a model can correctly classify new data points into predefined categories.</li>
<li>Attribute (feature): In machine learning, an attribute represents a specific characteristic of the data used to make predictions. For example, in the fruit example, &quot;color&quot; and &quot;size&quot; are attributes.</li>
<li>Node: A decision point in a decision tree, where the data is split based on a specific attribute.</li>
<li>Child node: A node resulting from splitting another node (parent node) based on an attribute.</li>
<li>Information gain: Another measure of impurity used in decision trees, which calculates the decrease in uncertainty about the class labels after splitting a node.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Gini index is a measure of impurity, used to assess the homogeneity of a node in a decision tree. It helps determine the best attribute (feature) to split a node to improve the classification accuracy of the tree.</p>
<h2 id="key-points-about-gini-index-in-decision-trees"><a class="header" href="#key-points-about-gini-index-in-decision-trees">Key points about Gini index in decision trees:</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Range: 0 (perfectly pure node) to 1 (perfectly impure node)
<ul>
<li>Interpretation:
<ul>
<li>Lower Gini index indicates a purer node, where most data points belong to the same class.</li>
<li>Higher Gini index indicates a more impure node, where data points are mixed across different classes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Function: Used to select the split that minimizes the Gini index, leading to purer child nodes further down the tree.</li>
<li>Alternatives: Palma Ratio is another common measure of impurity used in decision trees.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-impurity-in-decision-trees"><a class="header" href="#what-is-impurity-in-decision-trees">What is impurity in decision trees?</a></h2>
<p>Impurity tells you how uncertain you are about the class label of a data point if you were to pick one at random from that node.</p>
<p>It is the mean of the squared distances from the data point to its class label:</p>
<pre><code>Gini(D) = 1 - Σ(pi)²
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Imagine a node with 10 data points, 4 spam emails, and 6 non-spam emails.</p>
<pre><code>Gini(D) = 1 - (0.4)² - (0.6)² = 0.48
</code></pre>
<p>Here the data indicates a moderately impure node, with a 48% chance of misclassifying a random email.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="variable-to-decision"><a class="header" href="#variable-to-decision">Variable to Decision</a></h1>
<p>A decision tree starts with all its variables and tries to classify the data points. This selects andquot;bestandquot; variable (using additional measures) to divide the data, creating cleaner groups. This division by variables and their values continues until each group (leaf node) has essentially similar data points representing a final decision or classification. Think of it as a choose-your-own-adventure story where each choice (variable value) gets you closer to the answer (leaf node). This recursive process transforms the variables into clear decisions, making the tree a powerful classification and prediction tool.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="decision-tree"><a class="header" href="#decision-tree">Decision-Tree</a></h1>
<p>A decision tree is like a &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; for data. Imagine you have a basket of fruits and you want to sort them by type. The decision tree begins with a simple question: Is the fruit green or red? Based on your answer, you follow a specific branch to either green or red fruits. With each new branch, another question guides you - is the green fruit big or small? Is the red fruit round or oblong? By answering these successive questions, you will eventually reach the &quot;leaf node&quot; which tells the final category (eg apple, orange).</p>
<p>This structure transforms decision trees into efficient learning algorithms. They build a set of rules from the data, query at each node and follow the response path to a final prediction. This is useful for tasks such as classifying emails as spam, approving loan applications or forecasting customer turnover. Decision trees are easy to understand and interpret, making them valuable tools for exploring data and making informed decisions. However, they may be prone to overfitting and may not capture complex relationships between variables. Although decision trees are not perfect in every situation, they are still a popular and versatile choice for many data analysis tasks.</p>

<p>It is used when the target variables are discrete or categorical, with branching happening usually through binary partitioning. For example, each node may branch on a yes or no answer. Classification trees are used when the target variable is categorical, or can be given a specific category such as yes or no.</p>
<p>For eg: Lets take iris dataset as an example.</p>
<p>Code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, plot_tree
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

dt_classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)

dt_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

predictions = dt_classifier.predict(X_test)

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(&quot;Decision Accuracy:&quot;, accuracy)
</code></pre>
<p>The decision accuracy is 1.</p>
<p>This was a classification problem. So decision tree was a good model for this problem.</p>
